/**
 * The wheel: a list of cards mounted round the outside of a drum.
 *
 * The drum lies across the frame with its axis horizontal, so scrolling turns
 * it and the cards ride up and over. Card `i` sits (scroll - i) steps round
 * from the front, and the front is the middle of the picture — so the number in
 * the scroll is which card is being looked at, and the fraction is how far it
 * has been dragged towards the next one.
 *
 * That sign is the whole of which way a list runs: at rest the first card is in
 * the middle and everything after it hangs below, the way a page of anything
 * does, and turning the wheel forwards brings the next one up rather than
 * fetching the last one back.
 *
 * The drum is placed so its front is at the origin rather than its centre. Both
 * cameras then look at the origin and the card at rest is the same size under
 * either of them, which is the whole point of offering the two.
 *
 * Nothing is drawn on the far side. A drum is a loop and a list is not, so a
 * card that has been scrolled past has gone rather than come round: past the
 * arc it is switched off, and for the last few degrees before that it fades, so
 * it leaves rather than blinks. That also means the list can be longer than the
 * drum's own circumference without cards colliding with themselves on the far
 * side, which is the thing that makes a wheel a carousel and not a list.
